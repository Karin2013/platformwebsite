                            Light creates more than just visual effects (image, shape, intensity, perception, contrast, etc.); it also has biological and psychological effects that can impact the health and wellbeing of humans.

                        <p id="p13"> 
                            When light biologically impacts us, it can improve or disrupt our sleep, cognition and overall wellbeing. It can improve mood and stabilize our circadian rhythms, helping us get a better and deeper nights sleep. Psychologically, light can decrease depression scores and even increase cognitive performance such as reaction time and activation.

                            Artificial light is composed of visible light as well as some ultraviolet (UV) 
                            and infrared (IR) radiations, the emission levels of some lights could harm ones 
                            eyes and disrupt the human body clock and the hormonal system, therefore causing 
                            health problems.

                            The ultraviolet and the blue components of light have the greatest potential to 
                            cause harm, exposure to artificial bright light during the nighttime suppresses our 
                            melatonin secretion, which will affect our ability to fall asleep and also increases 
                            alertness. Our sleep cycle is crucial for human health because our bodies follow it 
                            for other biological functions such as cell regulation and hormone production, when 
                            artificial light disruptes the circadian cycle, severe health issues could happen, 
                            and we would be more prone to cardiovascular disease, depression, insomnia, and many 
                            other sleep disorder.
