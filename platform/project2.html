                        ‘Parasite’ is a movie that uses various cinematic tools (smells, 
                        way of thinking, planning of life, water, etc.) to distinguish between 
                        upper class and lower class in our society. And ‘sunlight’ is one of the 
                        tools that director Bong utilized to show class struggles.

                        On the other hand, a semi-basement is a house that a protagonist’s family lives 
                        in. In the first scene of the movie, old socks hanging by the window are receiving 
                        sunlight coming down from the ground. The window is at the highest position in the 
                        semi-basement. Placed on the side of the road, the noise of the street comes in without 
                        a filter. The family always has to raise one’s head to look up to see the world outside.

                        Now in the cities, as the population grows, buildings are built higher to contain people 
                        on a larger scale. And the amount of sunlight in rooms at the buildings can have become one 
                        of the key features that decides the price of the real estate. Natural light is commodified 
                        in modern society. Consequently, we can see that owning sunlight in a personal space is 
                        another form of power in Capitalism.
