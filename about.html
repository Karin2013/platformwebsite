                        Artificial light takes up huge amounts of space in our life. 
                        We use it to stay up all night to study, have dinner with 
                        friends in the restaurant, or even enjoy night life in the 
                        club. However, even though it takes up huge amounts of space 
                        in our life, it doesnâ€™t mean that it can replace natural light.

                        Sunlight uplifts our spirit. We sense a deep and strong relationship 
                        with nature. And it brings out the maximum capability of oneself when 
                        we start our day watching the sunrise. Also in architecture people live 
                        in, gently framed natural light visits our space, it curves sunlight. 
                        And from there, sunlight approaches us with a whole new different meaning 
                        from what we experience outside, containing or even extending narratives 
                        of space.

                        In the overpopulated city, however, we can no longer take natural light 
                        for granted in personal space. There is limited space in the city and 
                        sunlight has to be shared. In this project, we find the new meaning of 
                        light in our everyday life in the city to discover how owning light 
                        represents another form of power structure.
